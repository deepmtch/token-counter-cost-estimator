# token-counter-cost-estimator

This repository contains a bash script for counting tokens in text files and estimating the cost based on a per-million-token rate.

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x wordcount.sh
   ```

2. Run the script with file paths as arguments:
   ```
   ./wordcount.sh path/to/file1.txt path/to/file2.txt
   ```

3. Enter the cost per million tokens when prompted.

4. The script will output token counts for each file and the total, along with the estimated cost in cents.
